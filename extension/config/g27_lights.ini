FULLNAME=Logitech G27
PREVIEW=https://acstuff.ru/images/modules/g27_lights.jpg
DESCRIPTION=Options to change how G27 LEDs work. Allows to either disable it completely (so you can use a specialized tool like FanaLeds), or use a different algorithm. If syncing with virtual LEDs would fail, percentage-based approach will be used instead. To allow Python apps to set thresholds, set mode to either Virtual LEDs or Percentage.
SHORT_DESCRIPTION=Alter LEDs behavior
