FULLNAME=New AI behavior
PREVIEW=https://acstuff.ru/images/modules/new_behaviour.jpg
DESCRIPTION=Adds new AI behavior in track mode, creating seemingly endless traffic, and allows to drive wrong way in practice or track day (still WIP). Doesn’t affect online. Hopefully, more stuff will be added later.

[AI_RACE_RUBBERBANDING]
; AI rubberbanding
ENABLED=0 ; Active; 1 or 0; new
CHANGE_TIME=60 ; Time to apply; from 0 s to 300

INCREASE_BEHIND=0.1 ; Increase for cars behind; from 0 to 0.2, perc.
__HINT_BOTTOM=With rubberbanding cars behind would drive faster and cars in front would be slower (with AI level offset). Offsets grow from 0 to specified value based on how the time an AI car was ahead or behind (getting to full value at “time to apply”) and on how far is AI car from player (getting to full value at “distance to apply”).
